# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple interest calculator implemented as a bash script. It calculates the simple interest based on principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:
- **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money
- **Rate (R)**: Annual rate of interest (in percentage)
- **Time (T)**: Time period in years

## Usage

To use the simple interest calculator, run the following command:

```bash
bash simple-interest.sh
```

The script will prompt you to enter:
1. Principal amount
2. Annual rate of interest (%)
3. Time period (years)

## Example

```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest per year (%): 5
Enter the time period in years: 2

Simple Interest = 100
```
